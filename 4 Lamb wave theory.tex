\chapter{Theoretical temperature sensitivity of Lamb waves}\label{theory}

From the outcome of the literature review, a temperature monitoring system for nozzle guide vanes based on the temperature dependent wave velocity of Lamb waves has been investigated. In this section the temperature dependence of various Lamb wave modes has been calculated theoretically by producing dispersion curves from material properties. Dispersion curves have been generated for Aluminium, to be validated experimentally in Section~\ref{experiments}.

\section{Generation of dispersion curves}

Theoretical dispersion curves calculated from the material properties of Aluminium have been produced using \href{https://www.dlr.de/zlp/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-14332/24874_read-61142/#/gallery/33485}{The Dispersion Calculator}~\cite{Huber}. For isotropic media (Aluminium in this case) Rayleigh-Lamb equations are solved numerically to generate dispersion curves, based on the book by Rose~\cite{Rose2014}. The Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equations can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tan(qh)}{\tan(ph)}=-\frac{4k^2pq}{(q^2-k^2)^2}
\end{equation}

For symmetric modes, and:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tan(qh)}{\tan(ph)}=-\frac{q^2-k^2}{(4k^2pq)^2}
\end{equation}

For antisymmetric modes. Where $p$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    p^2=(\frac{\omega}{c_L})-k^2
\end{equation}

And $q$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    q^2=(\frac{\omega}{c_T})-k^2
\end{equation}

The wavenumber $k$ is numerically equal to $\omega/c_p$ , where $c_p$ is the phase velocity of the Lamb wave mode and $\omega$ is the circular frequency. The phase velocity is related to the wavelength by the simple relation $c_p = (\omega/2\pi)\lambda$. Group velocity is given by:

\begin{equation}
    c_g=c^2_p\left[c_p-(fd)\frac{dc_p}{d(fd)}\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

Where $fd$ denotes frequency times thickness. Note that, when the derivative of $c_p$ with
respect to $fd$ becomes zero, $c_g = c_p$. Note also that, as the derivative of $c_p$
with respect to $fd$ approaches infinity (i.e., at cutoff), $c_g$ approaches zero.

\section{The effect of temperature on wave propagation}

A change in temperature will affect material properties, namely Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Density. The change in density (thermal expansion) and Poisson’s ratio is negligible over the temperature of interest (20\si{\degreeCelsius}--100\si{\degreeCelsius}) in comparison to the change in Young’s modulus. Thermal expansion will cause a change in material dimensions which will also affect the wave speed, but the effect of this is small ($-$1.19 m s$^{-1}$ average change over 20--100\si{\degreeCelsius} for the $S_0$ mode). The change in Young’s modulus with temperature in Aluminium is close to linear, as represented by the Equation~\cite{Hopkins2012}: 
%
\begin{equation}
E\left( T \right) = \  - 4E7 \times T + 8E10\
\end{equation} 
%
Where $T$ is temperature in Kelvin, and $E$ is Young’s modulus in Pascals. 
The values of Young’s modulus produced by this equation have been used to generate the temperature dependant dispersion curves for aluminium shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grouptempshuftalu}. The angles of excitation required to excite the $S_0$, $A_1$, and $S_1$ modes are shown based on the frequency-thickness products of 1~MHz-mm (31\degree), 2.5~MHz-mm (24\degree), and 4~MHz-mm (28\degree) respectively. These frequency-thickness products correspond closely to group velocity maxima for each of the targeted modes, which is advantageous for separating the modes in the time domain~\cite{Alleyne1992}.

The group velocity of the $S_0$, $A_1$, and $S_1$ modes have been extracted from the curves at frequency-thickness products of 1~MHz-mm, 2.5~MHz-mm, and 4~MHz-mm respectively. The extracted group velocities are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:alugroupvel}. The temperature sensitivities of the modes are: 1.683--1.728 m s$^{-1}$\si{\degreeCelsius}$^{-1}$ for the $S_0$ mode, 0.928--1.018 m s$^{-1}$\si{\degreeCelsius}$^{-1}$ for the $A_1$ mode, and 1.444--1.548 m s$^{-1}$\si{\degreeCelsius}$^{-1}$ for the $S_1$ mode, over the temperature range 0--100\si{\degreeCelsius} (see Equation~\ref{eqn: eq k}). These values are frequency and mode dependent. The temperature sensitivities increase with temperature, as the modes reduces in frequency (shift left), and reduces in wave velocity (shift down).

\section{Multi-modal Lamb waves}

The multi-modal nature of Lamb waves makes their analysis complex, however this can be simplified by targeting specific modes using careful selection of excitation frequency, to target a particular frequency-thickness product. This difficulty can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:multimode} where a large number of different modes combine to create a multi-modal wave packet. Individual modes can be further isolated through the use of angled wedges, where the angle is chosen to target a particular mode. 

Below the cut-off frequency of the $A_1$ mode only the two fundamental modes ($A_0$ \& $S_0$) are present. Their phase/group velocities are sufficiently different from one another that the modes can be distinguished between in the time domain, assuming a long enough propagation distance. The use of wedge transducers can further isolate between the modes, as the wedge angle required to excite them are largely different. 

Above the cut-off frequency of the $A_1$ mode there are an increasing number of modes present. The relatively small difference in phase velocity between the higher order pairs ($A_1$ \& $S_1$, $A_2$ \& $S_2$, etc.) means that even with the use of wedge transducers it is not possible to selectively excite only one mode. The ability to differentiate between the modes is improved by targeting points of group velocity minima/maxima, where the modes are travelling with the largest differences in velocity, which helps to separate them in the time domain.
